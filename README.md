# pRoots-DAG-PLASMID
IPLD implementation on plasmid genomic data or genomic data. Here, we will produce a specific data scenario using IPFS to store genomic data and design specific data structure, which make routing on genomic data, just like search.
- data storage format
- data index
- IPLD schema to make routing just like search and comparisom of sequence


## Idea
- In bioinformatics, we query a sequence to a reference, which called alignment. And we can transform this knowledge into IPFS network. In order to have quick alignment on genomic data, there are some algorithm and data format designed for this. The process of alignment just like routing on content addressing.





## Implementation
